\title{Append a time value into a mongo.bson.buffer}
\usage{
mongo.bson.buffer.append.time(buf, name, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{buf}{(\link{mongo.bson.buffer}) The buffer object to which to append.}

\item{name}{(string) The name (key) of the field appended to the buffer.}

\item{time}{(integer) A time value.  This may also be an object of\cr class
"POSIXct", "POSIXlt" or "mongo.timestamp".}
}
\value{
TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE if an error occured appending
the data.
}
\description{
Append a date/time value into a \link{mongo.bson.buffer}.
}
\details{
BSON has a special field type to indicate a date/time; these are 64-bit
values.

However, R has a 'standard' object of class "POSIXct" used to represent
date/time values, such as that returned by Sys.time(). Internally these are
a 32-bit integer number of milliseconds since midnight January 1, 1970. On
January 19, 2038, 32-bit versions of the the Unix time stamp will cease to
work, as it will overflow the largest value that can be held in a signed
32-bit number. At such time, many applications, including R and this driver,
will need to address that issue.
