\title{Destroy a MongoDB connection}
\usage{
mongo.destroy(mongo)
}
\arguments{
\item{mongo}{(\link{mongo}) a mongo connection object.}
}
\description{
Destroy a \link{mongo} connection.  The connection is disconnected first if
it is still connected. No further communication is possible on the
connection.  Releases resources attached to the connection on both client
and server.
}
\details{
Although the 'destroy' functions in this package are called automatically by
garbage collection, this one in particular should be called as soon as
feasible when finished with the connection so that server resources are
freed.
}
\examples{
mongo <- mongo.create()
if (mongo.is.connected(mongo)) {
    n_people <- mongo.count(mongo, "test.people")
    mongo.destroy(mongo)
    print(n_people)
}
